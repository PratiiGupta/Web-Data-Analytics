I ordered six cotton tank tops, they deliberately sent me six polyester tank tops, and I refused to take my time and gas to return for a refund. Since it is NOT my mistake I should not have to PAY for their mistake. Needless to say, I will NOT be purchasing anything ever from this store again. They do not deserve my money, no way to run a business.",OldNavy
2023-06-25,Nancy hendrickson,4,Price is right!,"I order most of the things I wear from  different resources on line. Old Navy has decent selection of quality women’s items at very reasonable prices. My most recent order included pocket exercise shorts that I’m comfortably wearing now, 2 pair of linen pants, and a tshirt. With free shipping my total was less than $100.  All keepers and I especially look forward to wearing the black linen pants.",OldNavy
2023-07-18,William,1,No way to change order after completing,Ordered and mistakenly pressed complete order and there is no recourse to change the order. I wanted free shipping and wanted to order another item. There is no way to change but there should be. Zero customer service when seeking assistance from Old Navy!,OldNavy

2023-06-19,Lloyd,1,Poor customer service and business,Never received items purchased online. After 3 weeks of waiting for order. After speaking to 2 reps only have gotten the run around.

2023-04-11,TickleMEhappy,1,Despite spending $140.00 I got charged shipping fees for using Paypal,I have spent hundred of dollars over the years at Old Navy. My last three orders in the past five months have come back where something is no longer available and I’m being refunded my money. That was irritating enough. Today I noticed I’m being charged shipping fees despite my order being $140 dollars (before shipping). The customer service says it is because I’ve used PAPAL. No where does it state that you will charged that additional cost for using one of their options. Spoke to two separate people on the phone (April 11) and heard the same thing. My fault for choosing PayPal versus visa. I’m beyond livid and thinking of sending the entire order back.,OldNavy
2023-05-11,Kaishla Pacheco,1,Never get my full order!!,Never get my full order!!! I am always missing items or get items from someone else’s orders. Last refund I received I was told if I have any issues moving forward I need to call my bank and put a stop payment on the transaction. Since they have “extended the courtesy for a second time” This is ridiculous considering they cannot get any orders right. I received the last order I placed with them and again I am shorted an item. These people have non existent customer service & won’t help you recover items you didn’t get. Do count on it!,OldNavy
2023-07-08,kori broadhurst,1,In-store Credit No Longer,When did their return/exchange/in-store credit policy get so bad? I was one day past the 30 day window from when my order was delivered. All I was hoping for was in-store credit but was told it was passed the 30 days (by one day!). Items still had tags and I had a receipt. Just be aware this is their policy now. Frustrating.,OldNavy

2023-04-21,Whitney Estes,1,Terrible customer service,Terrible customer service. No allowances for exchanges after 30 days no matter the circumstances. I bought a few sets of pants in the same style but one was tall instead of regular which was only found on a small tag. I realized it 4 days after the 30 day window had passed. I tried to make an exchange but the store said couldn't do anything and told me to call online. I called online and they told me the only handle online orders! I was then redirected to who I was told could help me with the return but the person I was redirected to only asked I provide feedback on my customer service experience!,OldNavy

2022-12-19,Robin,1,Horrible. They shipped to wrong address,I placed three separate orders the first week of December. Old Navy shipped them to my old address although I had updated my shipping address. I called six times to get this fixed. They have customer service who do not speak understandable English.

The return was over 30 days because their downtown store closed out, where we had tried the return a week earlier.At this point, my wife spoke with a very unpleasant old man named Ralph. He was clearly reading off a script and mumbling his words. When my wife, who is Colombian, got confused, he made racist comments to her.

They don't handle returns and refunds on email and state on their site to call for an issue like that.  I called and they picked up the phone and didn't say anything.

2023-02-11,Lada,1,Wouldn't refund me for items that were stolen.,"Old Navy wouldn't refund me for stolen & missing items from my online order. Very poor customer service. I thought I could file the claim with the carrier who delivered the package. After several weeks, I was notified that the claim actually has to be file with the shipper. After contacting Old Navy's customer service, received a very unfriendly email that I can't get refunded for items that I claim are missing and if I want further assistance, contact my bank. That's the first red flag! There is definitely something going on between shipping and delivery. Needless to say I won't be shopping this Co anymore. Many of their things are poor quality anyway and pretty much unusable after one wash. I get to choose where to spend my hard earned money and if a company could care less about customers bad experience, it's not worth my hard earned money.",OldNavy

2023-01-16,Van,1,"Worn, stinky clothing, how sickening…","With Covid 19, influenza , RSV wrecking people’s lives right now, old navy shipped a piece of clothing that has an intense smell of cigarette smoke covered with this vomit 🤢 inducing body spray smell, with no tag to our home. Clearly, this piece of clothing has been worn, retuned then shipped to our home. Bag also has a “retouch tag/bin” sticker on it which distinctively shows that it was a returned item to old navy’s shipping center. It was mortifying and nerve wracking to open the shipping bag and be hit in the face/nose with that disgusting, horrendous smell. The bag had to be left outside for fear of what harm the smell could possibly do to our health and well being if left indoors. With no genuine apology given by the three customer service representatives that we spoke with… calls dropped/unable to hear the representatives, the resolution old navy gave us were: drive to UPS in the rain storms, drive to the store in the rain storms or mail the item back to old navy. All these options require a long waiting period before the refund can be processed. Reshipment of item was not offered.  For jeopardizing our safety and well being with the worn item they shipped to us, I was reluctantly offered 15% or 20% off coupon for future purchase which cannot be combined with any existing offers, which I politely declined. FYI: The only reason the 15% discount was offered was because I insisted on being compensated for our travel expense to and from UPS/a local store…#gasisexpensive#hellooldnavy. Either way, we have been inconvenienced by old navy’s incompetence and untrustworthiness. Why would I be excited about the 15% or 20% off coupon which cannot be combined with any other offers when currently they have 30% off discount including clearance on their website.

They also shipped the wrong sizes.I repeatedly asked to speak to a supervisor and was told one would call me back within 72 hours, but they never did.

2022-11-27,Jenny Good,1,Totally incapable!,"Avoid using Old Navy online if you don 't want to chance delivery issues! I bought a pair of jeans - JEANS - not some very expensive item that would normally require a signature. .UPS refused to leave them at the door, like normal shippers would, because according to them someone did not answer the door before 8am, on a weekend. They took them somewhere for ""pick up"". I do not want to inconvenience someone on my end to have to go pick up this item. I paid to have it SHIPPED not picked up. .I tried Old Navy's chat option to resolve this. Chat would not connect me with a human, and their AI was more artificial than intelligent. After a hide and seek session with their phone menu, I got a gal on the phone who hung up on me when trying to place me on hold. On my second calling attempt, I spoke with a guy who told me it is UPS' issue, not theirs. .I agree that UPS is HORRID but when ON chooses a shipper, they attach their customer experience to that shipper, so it should be their concern too. I could not get a human at UPS and was hung up on by their robot, right after she told me that they value my business. Oh the irony. .At this point, I plan to purchase a pair of jeans from a company that takes better care of their customers, and does not require a face-to-face delivery for a simple pair of pants. .This is extraordinarily bad business on so many levels. Including their response to my entering an after-call survey response of 0 on a scale of 0-10 regarding recommending their company to others... smart business would be to incorporate a policy of immediate follow up to make the customer who enters a 0 feel heard, and to resolve their issue. They did nothing of the kind. .Old Navy will get none of my business in the future, but they might want to hire me to help them create a better customer experience. Big box business or not, if you treat enough people poorly, you fold. Business is still personal.",OldNavy
2022-11-23,Rochelle,1,Old Navy Missing Items on online orders 2 times in a row.,"I have been buying from Old Navy for years and have increased my shopping to buying from Old Navy online. Today, I received my online order and it is missing a pair of toddler leggings. I called customer service to report the missing item from my 9 item order and was told a case would get opened and someone will email with the result of the investigation. This is so wrong! It is their fault for not packing the item, and I have to wait to hopefully receive a refund or a reorder in 2-3 business days? I swear their customer service was better before. This also happened on the order before this one. I also was missing an item and had to wait 3 business days to get an email showing a refund was processed. Because this is not convenient and because they are making back to back mistakes on their end, I no longer am interested in spending hundreds of dollars a year for myself and family. I'd rather just shop at Target or other stores that have better customer service. It is the worst to feel like you are lying or trying to take advantage. Really? For a $9 pair of leggings, I promise you I am not trying to get over and waist 20 minutes calling customer service. I am so upset.",OldNavy

Now today I go to my local Burlington WA store and cant find any size8 talls or any pants that are aimed at people who are not short! I was told they were not popular enough to keep on the shelves and i would have to order online. Screw you Old Navy I dont want to buy my jeans online. I enjoy my shopping day that i get once or twice a year. It hurt my feelings that tall people are not important enough to keep a small shelf of talls in your stores. I will be shopping somewhere else from now on and since I have no balance on my GAP CARD now I i will be cutting that up!

Again! and the only way to get a refund is to mail them back with the warehouse processing it all within 30 days of the order. Due to me placing the order for an elderly family member who lives a few hours away, this is nearly impossible to complete.The first time I received the wrong item, they refused to refund my money.Now I have $128 worth of incorrect items to return and no guarantee that it will be refunded.I have been an ON cardholder for about 10 years, have shopped with them with my kiddos and now this whole order, in combination with others totaled about $320 will need to be returned. They were the holiday family pajamas, which are out of stock now, all varieties! This company doesn't seem to care that they sent the wrong items (twice) and I will most likely not be refunded the money due to the circumstances.  The customer service rep i spoke with could not refund my money unless the wrong items were returned via mail. A supervisor, with the power to do so, was conveniently not available.

2022-04-03,Rosanne Fremming,1,Never able to log into my account,"Over at least the past 5 years, I have made multiple online purchases from Old Navy. Every time I have done so, I have been unable to sign into my account despite multiple attempts to change my password, switch to a different device, clear my cache, reboot my electronic device and call into customer service (who has never been able to rectify this situation).  I do not recall ever having been able to make an online purchase without having to do so as a guest. I can't even sign in on my Old Navy app because of this issue. I do not know if my points from my online purchases as a guest are actually added to my account because I cannot log into my account to view this.  I doubt it, as I have few (if any) points racked up to take advantage of when I have gone into an Old Navy store.  I am wondering if this is done intentionally to random people in order to make more money off of people who regularly spend money at Old Navy. Seems needless and really underhanded for a huge publicly traded corporation to stoop to such low levels to save a few bucks on ordinary, middle-income families.  The products themselves are of good quality otherwise I wouldn't continue to shop there.

The day they were to be delivered, I checked the tracking to see what it said and it still confirmed they were to be delivered that day. Nothing showed up by the end of the day, so I checked the tracking and the delivery date disappeared and instead it said as of 12/1 it was delayed, but that had never been mentioned before. There was no sign of anything over the next week beyond 12/3. Today, 12/10, I contacted ON via online chat and the person was very helpful and issued a full refund. Hopefully I’ll see that soon, but I’m still not sure what happened. Why say it has shipped if it never has?

Old navy rep said they don’t know who they use until the order is shipped. Does this make sense? FedEx is notorious for not making an attempt at all.They just slap a sticker on our buzzer panel and leave. My manager of the building saw it! I had that happen previously from FedEx. I contacted FedEx regarding what happened, they denied the possibility that this might have ever happened. The location which is the pick up place is sitting at the edge of the North East end of town, a two hour bus ride and I couldn’t get the package for 3 business days which has a weekend in the middle. I am leaving Monday, July 5th and it was supposed to be at my place on June 30th. I told the rep I would never buy from there again, she didn’t care, or the obvious the company has no interest, I’m just one customer, what does that matter right? I demanded to talk with a manager after waiting a considerable amount time I didn’t get a manager which I’d asked for but I got a refund for the shipping.

I had no trouble getting into my account to order again but after that 2nd order I was never able to get back into my account! It kept rejecting my password and the password reset did't work so I had to get a temporary password from customer service.  It happened again and I stopped trying to get in, now I know why they didn't want me to get back, I would have known that the items they were sending me were not what I ordered! I ordered foil dotted leggings and a loose sweatshirt in larger size than usual! More on that later, the 2nd package delivery was worse than the 1st. It went UPS MAIL INNOVATIONS, should just be called: HOW TO SCREW UP A CUSTOMER'S LIFE! It left by plane from California on the 18th, and landed in Northern Ohio(I live in Ohio) it went to Michigan, then it went to Pennsylvania(you have to go through Ohio to get to Pittsburgh) it arrived on the 27th! I wish it had never arrived because the sweatshirt that was a 2X(a size up from my usual 1X) was so tight I had to get it off me, and the tiedye was so embarrassing, it said it was specially made, for who a HOOKER? The breast areas have  tie dye explosive circles around each breast! Now to what were supposed to be leggings, they were pants with a tight high waist, a zipper with slide clips and short pockets(what's the use of having pockets if you couldn't ever use them as pockets) not to mention they looked really really old, like they had been stored in that bag for a really really long time? Both bags had been opened and badly retaped, so somebody else hated them too! Now, I ask you, can I return this crap, NO because they will refund my gift card again, like I want to order anything else? I can't return it to a store because they don't put receipts in the bag and their emails have red letters spelling out that you can't use the emails as a receipt! So I took a trash bag out and I'm starting a Goodwill bag, maybe a thrifty street walker will be able to use both those items, I just want them outta my house!

2020-12-12,Nicholas Kau,1,Never work at old navy,My girlfriend has worked at old navy for about 2 months and they’ve been awful. First off she’s a student so her availability isn’t as flexible. They promised to accommodate her but they schedule her for during school. We then had her availability changed and they still did the same thing. They’ll also schedule her for days that she specifically marked as unavailable. And it’s not just once or twice. It’s every single week. We’ve had to turn our lives upside down because my girlfriend is bending over backwards for a company that can’t even pay her right.  Countless times they’ve put her to work in a position that she’s never been trained to do and it’s driving her stress levels through the roof. It’s absolutely ridiculous and no one should have to put up with some of the stuff they throw at her. I am utterly disgusted with some of the things i hear and for those reasons and many more i will never take part in anything having to do with Old Navy again.,OldNavy

2020-11-30,Robyn,1,Bad Customer Service,Their customer service department is not very customer service oriented. A small address error was made on my end and customer service could not fix even though I called immediately. I was advised to contact the carrier once it was shipped out. Funny thing is the carrier requires the shipper to change the address. Guess it will be returned and I will have to wait for a refund since the mailing address doesn’t exist. Awful customer service. A small issue like that should be able to be corrected and their customers should not have to spend a ton of time trying to correct it. Old Navy is not great quality anyways and this was a Christmas gift. I won’t be ordering from this company or it’s affiliates again.,OldNavy

OMG! When we pulled up Ibtellbya no exaggeration it was empty we walk in maybe 1 or 2 customers there uf we were lucky so I figured its early people will cone later. I went on search if Pajamas whethervit was gowns pants with tops any PJs were fine.vso after searching the whole store to my sadness they had only the lounge ones the little fuzzy ones. Now they were from size 5 to 14. Oh I firget to tell all supposedly everything in the store was 50 percent off. So you know my jaw dropped to the floor can you velieve those little lounge pants were 19.99 each I thought is was a darn joke but there ut was 20.00 for a pair of Pajama bottoms !! WTH is going on?? Then I realized that there was no black Friday sale.they just fixed the prices to where your paying regular prices anyway but wanted everyone to think they had 50 percent off. How horrible is that?? And Im curioys usnt that price gauging?? Im so disgusted to the point that when we pay off this credt card. I will be cutting into little pieces and never return to that Store.,OldNavy

Where to begin, the items slowly started arriving in different packages. Very unprofessional for such expensive mediocre clothing. Lastly I ordered winter shirts for myself on November 4th, the original delivery date says November 13th. That date came and went. New delivery date says November 23rd, but it has already been updated to say now the delivery estimate is November 30th. Tracking info says UPS but guess what my package has been given to Pitney Bows and is literally down the street from my home awaiting delivery since November 13th?? I am so over it.

I was going to purchase winter clothing with my Super Cash in mid November but my Super Cash expires November 1st.  So my Super Cash will be invalid when I decide to shop at a time convenient to me.I have sent customer service an email with comments regarding their Super Cash program.  They responded by sending me an automatic email (heading:  Dear Valued Customer) giving me instructions for returns etc.  So this means that management does not view concerns from customers.  Is this because Old Navy is an American based company who only cares about profit and not the actual customer?  I am well aware of how profit works but there should be a balance between the customer and the company.  Valued customers should be more important to a huge corporation like Old Navy.As a result of this rating, I will not be shopping at Old Navy again and will pass on the word regarding my experience.",OldNavy

2020-10-10,elicious cyril,1,UNETHICAL AND UNCARING ATTITUDE EXHIBITED BY OLD NAVY,"I placed an order consisting of seven items with Old Navy as a gift for a loved one on September 19, 2020. The order's intended destination was Miami, Florida. I subsequently received confirmation that the items were split in two orders consisting of 5 items and 2 items respectively. According to UPS both orders were delivered at its intended address on September 25, 2020 within an hour of each other. The loved one received the order consisting of 5 items and did not received the other item. However, i just anticipated that it may have been delayed. When it wasn't delivered by October 10, 2020, i decided to reach out to a live chat agent at Old Navy and gave her the order number and particulars. The distasteful thing is that Old navy never reached out to me, however i was given a lame excuse that 'the item got losted in transit'. When i expressed that these two items were the favourite of the recipient i was informed that it is out of stock and all i can receive right now is a refund and discount on my next order. I was sent a confirmation email with the refund and insulted with a 15% discount on my next order with Old navy having been a long standing customer.No effort was made to retrieve or see whether the items are available at other branches/outlets at least in an effort to appease the customer.I have since deleted my old navy account and will no longer be shopping in store or online and won't encourage anyone to do so due to the lousy customer relation and uncaring attitude dispalyed. If i wasnt vigilant i would have been swindled of hard earned cashed.Goodbye Old Navy.",OldNavy

This is the second time that I have caught them giving each reward dollars the same reward number so that only one can be used and the other just disappears, meaning I lose those reward dollars. I've probably lost out on other reward dollars and haven't noticed. SECOND PROBLEM: I've had multiple online orders where items have been removed because they are no longer available. Who's in charge of making sure they're not available BEFORE the purchase is made? THIRD PROBLEM: I emailed customer support and they sent an email back that ""We have received your email. Due to the unusually high volume of calls, we are unable to respond."" So, they're not going to help me via email so I call wait 20 minutes for help. The gal that helped me was pretty distracted and didn't have any explanation regarding the problems.

However, the tracking for UPS didn’t show when it will actually be delivered.  It took exactly 5 weeks to arrive to my front door.  It was the same for my sister’s order around the same time.  I love their products and their prices, but they have to work on better delivery and keeping customers up to date on their orders.  The phone line was a joke. I waited 40mins and hung up.  For those people who haven’t received their orders after a month, I highly recommend you contact your bank or credit card to start a chargeback process.  They will need your order number and proof of email that it was shipped.  They will investigate and refund you the money that you cannot get ahold of old navy to.

Yes, cancer, not covid. I track my package before the funeral and thankfully I hope I'll have pants to wear to her funeral. Wrong. Apparently the package came (as I'm at home) and because no one answered the door it was sent back? Yeah I was confused too. So, I sent an email to Old Navy explaining how I've waited OVER 2 months AND have already been billed. ""Your estimated response time is 3 days"". No response at all. I'm still waiting because well what can I do? Then, these morons have the nerve to charge another 100 to my account to which I sent another email and go no response...but I did get a refund. Its funny too because I'm waiting for my stuff and I get an email about how supposedly Old Navy has donated 30 million in clothes due to the situation with Covid. Couldn't laugh harder thinking how dumb that claim is when they can't even send out PAID for product. Do not waste your time.

I have not made any purchases at Old Navy since. The amounts taken out of my account today were for the amounts 57.50 and 23.81.

Also sent them an e-mail response came back as they are busy due to covid 19 please call?? They charge me the full amount right away and then it looks like they are charging again separately for the items. Looks like a big fraud going on, please do not order anything from them.

Called on July 5th about the status of the first item got the brush off from an agent saying there was delays in their warehouse and to wait until July 13th. Called back July 14th as no change in status waited over an hour the first time and than got hung up on. Second time the agent said they order it ready and waiting for UPS to pick up and has been and the agent on the 5th provided the wrong information. And they can’t say when they will pick it up. I ask if they could escalate or email the warehouse team to ensure this was sitting around and forgot about. Said there was nothing he could do and I would just have to wait. Second suggestion was to order again and hopefully I didn’t have the same problem but couldn’t promise anything. Called UPS they said old navy never schedule the pick up. Stuck in limbo now.

2020-06-29,Pale blue Dot,1,I am in the same predicament,"I am in the same predicament as the other customers. I placed an order on June 5th and got a tracking number on June 8th from UPS. It's June 29th today. No package. No update from UPS. It just says a label was created June 8th. Meantime, I have ordered other things on line and have received them within days with no issue. Why create a UPS label and send out notification saying ""HOORAY your order is on it's way"" when there is no package. If you can't keep up with the orders, maybe be honest with your customers about it. I also tried to email many times and it just kept bouncing back. Today I tried to call, but after 30 mins of being on hold I hung up. Also I didn't want to hold any longer after reading people waiting for 2 - 3 hours!Terrible customer service!

All I want to do is ask them where my order is because I ordered something at the beginning of June and I still don't know where it is. I have a UPS tracking number, but that doesn't give me any information besides this: ""The sender created a label for your shipment. When we receive it, we’ll show additional scans and the delivery date. UPS My Choice® for home provides delivery alerts and is the only way you can make delivery changes while the package is in transit.If it has been several days since this scan was created, contact the sender to confirm the package was picked up. Our representatives are unable to provide more information at this time.""What a waste of time. Very disappointed with Old Navy right now. Very disappointed.

By the time I get what I ordered from Old Navy, IF I ever get them, summer will be over    I’ve emailed numerous times only to get an automated reply 5 DAYS LATER with the same excuse.  Tried calling but after waiting an hour on line it gets old.  Hard to believe UPS is giving great service to other businesses except Old Navy.  Why would that be?   I’ve been charged for 3 orders that have been placed a month ago that still have not been picked up.     I would like my orders cancelled but that’s unlikely to happen since it’s not Old Navy's problem.  I’m sure other customers would love to see them go out to their pick up container and retrieve their parcels as well.  Perhaps if They are blaming UPS they should focus on customer service and ship through a different carrier.

Opening in anticipation of what prints I would receive only to find three solid white ones along with two pale pink And white stripe! Thinking how the picture of the prints were when I ordered, they sent me whatever was left before they put out round two of making them. So I received the tail end of whatever was left. Called customer service after waiting for just about two hours. And another twenty  five minutes for a supervisor, nothing but an apologize they would NOT send me a new set of masks even when admitting they were wrong. After expressing what I thought they should do the supervisor hang up on me. I wanted them to make it right. I will not shop at old dirty navy anymore neither will my daughter. They gave me a code for twenty percent off. And after going in circles with the supervisor I got six dollars and fifty cents off the masks. Was it worth getting upset over to deal with these awful customer service people, never! They just don’t care. Remember this is an item needed.",OldNavy
2020-06-14,Jen Perrin,2,Have lost all trust in this company,"I have ordered on this website before and have had no issues in the past but lately it’s been very disappointing! I placed an order on May 26th (a fairly large order, about 16 items), I went with the no rush shipping because it said I would still get my items by June 16th and part of the order was for my daughters birthday which is on the 23rd so I wasn’t concerned. A week after I placed the order I got an email saying 4 items were not available so they would be removed from my order...ok not a huge deal. Then my order sat with no shipping notification and in the meantime I had some old navy cash and a 10% off coupon that I received for my cancelled items so I thought I would order my nephew some clothes for his bday. I placed that order at the beginning of June (again with no rush shipping) and it had all shipped within a week and is already being delivered! So I was concerned my order got misplaced so I sent an email, no response and called on Friday. I got through right away and the guy was super nice but felt like he was giving me some bs about how some items can’t be shipped to Box numbers so that is why they are cancelled..don’t really believe that but whatever. Anyways my order said it would still arrive on time (June 16th) and it is now the 13th and it hasn’t shipped yet (there is no way it’s arriving on time at thus point) and now tonight I got 2 separate emails that 2 more items were no longer available! So I’m down to maybe getting 10 of my 16 items, we will see what the actual number is once this order actually ships!! Totally disappointed as I feel as though this order was missed being fulfilled.",OldNavy

I have also now called customer no service 3 times. The 1st two times I held for 25 min each and hung up . I have now been on hold for 48 minutes and no service still has not come on .

2020-07-27,Robin Dotson,1,Not a happy customer,"I placed an order on May 12th for 2 variety packs of  their masks. After doing so, I was notified due to Covid 19, there would be a delay, I understood that and was ok with it. Two weeks ago I checked the status and it said they would be shipped on June 7th or 8th and I would get an email once shipped. Nothing so far, so I checked again and now it's July 7th. The ironic thing is that I received an email advertising ""masks are back in stock"" if I want to place an order. My card hasn't been charged yet,  which I appreciate but this is no way to keep a customer. This will be the first and last order I ever place with you!Update****So I finally get my order of 2 variety packs of masks.

2020-06-11,Mel,1,The website is a nightmare then they didn't ship my stuff- ever,"The website is a nightmare. SLOW. The screens move around on their own and flash to different screens making it difficult if not impossible to use. No customer should need to endure this and need that much patience to order. The cart removes items that sell out but does not notify the buyer in any way. Things are in your cart and then they are gone with no notice, just deleted. The shipping is ridiculous. Slow.  Items are shipped from different places , store stock perhaps, so it is very hard to track if and when your items arrive and if the order is complete. I placed an order which took hours to place and I had to take a break between browsing sessions because the site is so frustrating to use. I actually had to place two orders because thing in the cart disappeared so I had to try to remember what they were and go back to try for different sizes or alternatives. 22 days after my order was placed I got two emails telling me that 39 individual items that I bought were not able to be shipped. Yeah, 39 things I bought are not ever coming. I heard nothing for 22 days!!! But don't worry they gave me a 10% off coupon for next time. I have ordered tons of stuff online since the shelter-in-place order and none have been late, or canceled. Amazon has been slow running a few days to a week slower than normal, but old Navy has really taken it to the next level. The Clothes are okay for the money usually but it is not worth the tax on your life force!!! Save yourself the aggravation and shop anywhere else.",OldNavy

I called up customer service which I magically got through within 2 minutes of wait time! but this lady literally rushed through my request, I couldn't even ask her another question before she hung up on me. I was left confused if my cancellation was processed. I did check the following day on the order status through phone (an automated prerecorded procudure), and it was cancel! (THANK GOODNESS) To be honest, Old Navy is never really on my list of stores that I go to because of their style and weird sizing, before covid I did pick up a cute pink corduroy jacket, quality was good. But it was a really out of the blue purchase, saw it at the store front when I passed by. My last purchase before this was probably .....10+ years ago?

If it does not work, I need to contact them again - when the shipment is returned as undeliverable, and they'll see what can be done about it.This process sounds way too complicated and time consuming so I asked to cancel the order. I was informed that they can ""attempt"" to cancel but it's not guaranteed, and if that doesn't happen, see the previous scenario.To say that this is ridiculous would be a tremendous misrepresentation but they see nothing wrong with it.",OldNavy

,Susan Leclair,1,Lies and a WASTE OF TIME,"WORST EXPERIENCE. Initially ordered my clothes at the beginning of April. The order then was flagged by their automated security check and my order was cancelled. I received an email in regards to this action and contacted the customer support line. I was not able to be told why my order was cancelled or flagged as they do not have access to those parameters. (My order was over $300.00). I then jumped back and forth between reps for 6HOURS to finally be passed to someone who explained they will reorder it in a couple days, apply discounts and waive my 1 day delivery fee I paid for initally AND WILL STILL HONOR THAT ONE DAY SHIPPING- Famous last words here folks! It has been a week and a half. I have ZERO insight on where or when my package will arrive to my home. I have been PROMISED on multiple occassions that it will arrive ""by the end of the business day ma'm"" and it never does. My frustration is DO NOT CHARGE $22.00 FOR 1 DAY SHIPPING OR CLAIM YOU WILL HONOR YOUR 1 DAY SHIPPING IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Was offered 20% off my next order with Old Navy. Yeah no.

The second time I spoke to the same lady I have spoken to previously which was on 04/17/2020 Friday at 8:37PM this lady made my whole experience impossible for me everything was so negative about her I was able to pick up on her attitude as well. Well today 04/23/2020 at 9pm I called and that same negative lady answered and all I wanted was to try to switch one of my items to a different color (that was just placed not even shipped) and there again everything so impossible with a negative attitude. So I asked to speak to a supervisor before he got on the line his name was Ryan he laughed and answered. I explained the situation but him again making everything in possible. I asked him so if I were to go to the store in person and tell the worker can you please remove this item I can’t afford it she won’t be able to do it and he said “no they’ll tell you the same.” He gave me the same energy the lady gave me and I told him I don’t appreciate your attitude And he changed his voice tone and I informed him just because you change your voice tone it doesn’t mean your not giving me an attitude I have been working in customer service for many years. My point is I would have liked if someone were to explain to me or say to me “I’m extremely sorry but our system won’t allow us to.” Instead of saying “No I can’t do that for you once it’s done it’s done.” I rarely place reviews anywhere but this really disappointed me I was a loyal shopper at Old Navy I’m for sure not shopping here again.,OldNavy

2019-10-15,Cheri,1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!,"I have been shopping at Old Navy for over 25 years.  I have a credit card with their company and have for years.  I have done most of my clothing shopping for my five kids, and now their spouses.  Well I went in August to buy matching clothes for my whole family (9 people) for family pictures.  I spent over $700 that day.  I went in last week to return 2 pair of jeans and 4 blouses that didn't work, and all of them were unworn with tags still on them.  I had my original receipt.  The lady at the register told me since it had been over 45 days, she had to give me the sale price.  I told her that was fine, and asked why it wasn't 90 days like it was in the past, but that I understood the policy.  Then she said she could only give me in store credit, and again I said it was fine, even though I would have preferred credit back to my Old Navy card.  Then she rang it all up, and it came to just over a hundred dollars.  She put the clothes behind her and then turned to give me my receipt and she said, ""Oh I'm sorry, your return has been rejected.""  I asked her why and she said I would have to call the company on the receipt and there was nothing she could do.  So I had her gather the clothes up and I left.  I had other errands to run and so I called while I was driving around.  I was on hold with that company for 47 minutes.  When the man finally answered, he asked for the transaction ID number.  I gave it to him 4 times and he said there wasn't anything under that number.  So he asked for my license, and he said the same thing.  He said I had to go to the customer service counter at Old Navy itself to resolve it.  At that point I couldn't get back to Old Navy before it closed so I went again tonight.  I explained to the girl at the register what had happened and asked if there was anything I could do to return the clothes.  She said, ""we can just return them as if you didn't have your receipt.""  Odd, because I did, but I said that was fine, please just return them.  So she rung them all up and asked for my license.  So I said, is my license going to be attached to the last time I tried to return them?  And she said No.  But sure enough, it was, so my return was rejected again.  She called her manager and he said there isn't anything he can do, apparently my license has locked me from being able to return anything at Old Navy because I keep trying without my receipt.  I am livid.  I have never returned anything there without a receipt, AND they can look it up on my credit card statement.  So now I have a bag full of clothes that don't fit, and Old Navy employees and managers that said it's out of their hands.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE in the world!  Those clothes are still hanging in their store, they are from less than 2 months ago, not 2 years ago.  To top it off, I went tonight to return a pair of jeans to American Eagle that I also bought on picture day and they happily gave me my money back.  And then to JC Penney to return two shirts from the same day, and they happily returned those as well.  If I could give Old Navy zero stars, I would.  I am SO disappointed by the way I was treated in both stores and I'll do everything in my power to convince everyone I know to never set foot in another Old Navy again.",OldNavy

When I called on Wednesday to get a price adjustment (mind you my order has not even been shipped out yet), the customer service agent told me that they could not honor the price adjustment because extra promotions do not count as price mark downs.  Essentially the company policy plays with words to make you believe they honor price adjustments but in reality they really do not.  All they will offer is to give me a future coupon (10%) so that hopefully I will spend more money with them.  NOPE, I declined the coupon and will not buy anything from BR ever again.

Yes, the clothes are on the pricey side, but, they are made from linen, wool, silk, leather, suede—all being luxury materials.  Yes, their “final sales—no returns accepted” is a strict policy, but often prices are marked way down because of it and I either don’t shop those items—if size/fitting is in any way an issue.  They have styles that are hard to come by in other online shoppes and the return to their original styles is a serious ++.  My only qualms would be to not have so many cropped sizes on shirts and not such voluminous pants as most reviews on those items show that’s not a big fav with many of us.  Other than that, love them!",BananaRepublic

Then the true madness of BR hit me.  15 days after returning the product, I received it back to my mailbox...in a packaging mess of ripped plastic and tape and labels all over.  Upon contacting BR to find out why it was shipped back to me, they said that receiving staff found there to be no issue with the product so it was returned to me.  What???  They will not accept my return of a brand new unused product, minus the shipping cost argument???  What is this place?  Customer service (Christina B) told me to file a dispute through my bank transaction, so that is what I will do.  Not for the money but for the principle of the matter.

I returned an item within 24 hours of my receipt using the company's prepaid shipping label.  Unfortunately, the shipment was apparently lost in transit.  Although I provided Banana Republic with a copy of my UPS receipt validating my (prompt) return of the item, the company refused to issue a refund until the lost shipment was located and / or a claim was submitted.  I informed both the representative and supervisor that this issue was between Banana Republic and their 'contracted shipper' and does not involve the customer.  Further, I asserted that their refusal to issue my refund due to a problem with their shipper is a violation of my consumer rights.  However, PayPal issued my rightful and long overdue refund immediately following the initiation of a dispute claim.  Sadly, Banana Republic's continuing pattern of numerous negative online reviews is indicative of their failure to micromanage staff training, their level of knowledge specific to policies and consumer rights, and personable customer service skills.

I have purchased a pair of black dress pants from BR early this year and started wearing them to work just now. Guess what, they have stained everything they touched black. My skin, my office chair, my white silk top and my purse. Great! A pair of cheap, $70 pants ruined everything they touched. BR's quality product went dramatically down in the last 10 years and this was the last straw. I will never purchase from them again. There are other clothing companies out there that have respect for the customers and stand behind the quality of what they sell. Like Club Monaco for instance. I'd rather pay more and buy less and save myself the frustration by dealing with BR's garbage clothing.",BananaRepublic

I went into the returns section on their website and they sent me the shipping label. I returned the product using the shipping label they provided and I have tracking of the product saying it was delivered. I emailed the company after a couple of weeks querying the delay with the refund. Approx one month later Banana Republic emailed me to say that they could not see the details of where it was delivered in the UK but out of courtesy they would issue a refund. Out of courtesy! I explained that this was not an issue of courtesy and that I had followed their returns directions and used the shipping label that they provided so if there were any issues with the delievery then that was their problem with the shipping company. It is not a courtesy get your money back when you follow the companies own procedure! I would liken Banana Republic to scam artists based on this.They also do not forward complaints to senior managers despite several requests to do so; or else the senior managers are just as clueless and horrible.If I were you I would avoid Banana Republic altogether they are obviously unprofessional, rude and don’t understand their obligations or their responsibilities.

2023-09-04,Ty,1,Gap/ LaserShip is a JOKE,Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love Gap but this 3rd party they’re using for the courier LaserShip is the main reason behind this review. They claimed to have delivered my package at 12:31pm yet I have no activity on my ring camera from 11:28am-1:08pm no package & someone was home to accept it . I guess the thought never crossed their mind to ring the bell either. I reached out to LaserShip & they did nothing but tell me to contact Gap so I did.  I then did research on this 3rd party courier only to see that the reviews are HORRIBLE which explains the issue I’m having along with others. Gap hasn’t done anything to resolve or accommodate me as the customer because they continue to use them as a courier. Moral of the story is moving forward I will no longer patronize the Gap because I’m out of money & merchandise and they still got paid so they’re winning the couriers who are stealing is getting paid to deliver “BUT AREN’T” & is getting the merchandise the customers have paid for!!! If I could give Gap & LaserShip 0 stars I definitely would because I feel they’re working together.,GAP

I thought to myself that I would have plenty of time after returning from the trip to return my order and did not make that the focus while trying to get ready. I learned today that Gap's shipment policy is 30 days from shipment date and not delivery date, so I missed the window for returns of items that don't fit me. For what it's worth, I ordered on May 31 and received on June 6. Since some orders take up to ten days to receive (and probably will be longer if the UPS strike occurs in August), I just don't find this a fair policy or one that is the norm. I imagine I'm not the only one who relied on consumers norms and got burned. For that reason and a few others not mentioned here, I will not be ordering from Gap again.

You would think the customer would use the Credit on another purchase and perhaps buy other items.  Sorry Gap, you lost another customer.  Keep it up, you will not be around too long!!",GAP
2023-02-06,Tiffany Haley,1,Delayed Shipping…,"I have never shopped Gap online or in store prior to a few weeks ago. I ordered some baby items online (matching bodysuits and pants). I also ordered a few Old Navy items at the same time, since it's a joint website. The items from Old Navy arrived in two days and all together, neatly wrapped and packaged, obviously from a fulfillment center. The items from Gap (according to tracking info) were sent separately, apparently from various stores (had I known this I wouldn't have ordered). The shipping said they would arrive in 3-5 business days. I received several separate emails regarding the individual items saying ""we're so sorry for the delay, but we don't know when your item will arrive"" and another that said ""awaiting cancellation"". On EVERY item I ordered from Gap. So, I called. The item ""awaiting cancellation"" wasn't available. Ok fine, then please don't send me the matching pants. Well, that's not possible, but you can send them back for a refund. Two of the items eventually arrived and were obviously someone's return, no tags and dirty. So, I returned all three of these items via their express returns at Staples (we do not have a Gap store nearby), and two weeks later, no refund yet. The last item still hasn't made it. It was supposed to arrive on Feb. 3, but now has a date of Feb. 9. They did refund that item since it doesn't appear to actually be moving away from where it was sent and towards it's destination, per tracking. Overall, I'm still stuck with half outfits due to items not being available or having not arrived. I will NEVER order from Gap again. I was offered a 15% off coupon to compensate, however I declined because all the frustration is simply not worth it. All the bad reviews I've read seem to deal with this same issue.",GAP

The return window closed on February 2rd (30 days). Really one day?!! They cannot offer the store credit. I ordered the bigger size of the  hoodie, so I didn’t need the smaller size anymore.

Send back the duplicated item and then repurchase the item we failed to include.  My solution?  Send me the item you omitted  and let me just keep the duplicate ($6).  Why do I have to run to the UPS store to return your mistake and then reorder the item you forgot and wait another week for it to arrive? Also, you tell me that my credit could take up to 15 days for the item I'm returning.  Unacceptable.",GAP

All their small sizes sold out well before Christmas. Now they are trying to unload overstock of large sizes.Their policy is a scam.

There is an old saying that goes ""If it is not broken, don't fix it.""  Every other store is the Gap except the one in Oceanside, NY.   The stores in Merrick, NY and Roosevelt Field have stayed the original ""Gap.""Please note that while prices may be cheaper at The Gap Factory the quality of clothes are definately not the same.

I tried contacting customer support about this, but after several minutes of non-answers I started the process of closing my account out of concern that someone had accessed it. (This is not an easy process and I don't trust that it's been completed.)Several hours later I received an email that a technical error meant the order wasn't available and that they cancelled the order on our behalf. The email was written as if it effected more than just me. I'm not sure why they feel that 10% off an order that will likely not arrive in Christmas is an appropriate response to this mistake, especially when I had almost an entire month I could have shopped elsewhere if they had let us know about this ""technical mistake"" earlier. The quality of their clothes are barely worth the price (and never worth full price) and they are definitely not worth the headache.",GAP

I asked to speak to her supervisor,  and she disconnected me. I called again, and I was speaking to a rep, and all of a suddena voice cuts into our conversation and it was an automated survey of my experience.  The cs rep was no longer connected to me.

I was told to wait and if I didn't get the package by 12/15 to call back for a refund. Not satisfied with this response I checked with the delivery agent (UPS). Their on-line tracking shows that the package was indeed delivered on 11/30 but to a guy named Steve at his house. I have his address and the only thing it has in common with mine is that it is in the same state. So I called customer service again to tell them that there is no sense in my waiting for a package that Steve is now enjoying and to ask for a refund. I was again told that their system will not allow a refund to be processed until December 15th.

2022-10-07,Katherine,1,WT*F Gap.,"As a lifelong Gap shopper, I'm super disappointed to be writing this review. I purchased two dresses online to choose one for an upcoming wedding. They arrived on separate days. The Gap has changed its return policy to 30 days FROM the SHIP DATE! One of the dresses took 15 days to arrive, and I shipped it back to the GAP within 48 hours. It also took another 15 days to get to their warehouse - using the return label that they generated for me. They refused to take it back and shipped it back to me with a note that said they received it after their 30-day window. Considering 30 days was *literally* spent shipping, I am now stuck with a $100 dress that does not fit me right. I reached out to customer service, and they gave me 20% off my next purchase. This was during the pandemic when everything was being delayed with shipping - and my family and I had COVID when it arrived, so I could NOT actually return it to the store. (It seems like during this time of such upheaval, you'd be considerate of your customers - and at least offer store credit if you are going to change your return policy so drastically.) Long story short - I cut all my credit cards up and have boycotted them all together.",GAP

I placed the order on the 17th because I needed it for a wedding I'm attending on the 25th. Why was my order canceled? Why is it impossible to stay connected to your service team?

2022-01-18,Safiyyah scott,1,No refunds,"I ordered 3 jackets and a hat on Nov. 29, 2021. I received that order on Dec. 4, 2021. One of the jackets I ordered was missing out of the package and there was a pair of joggers I didn’t order inside instead. I contacted gap customer service and was suppose to be emailed a return label and a discount code for my next purchase and I was told I would receive my refund in 3-5 business days. That email never showed up so I had to call back and explain that whole situation again! This time I was sent a return label and the discount code, that I tried to use to reorder the same jacket but it did not work. Also, on this call the customer service rep said it would be 10 business days for my refund. I mailed off the item that was sent accidentally, not my fault, it was their mistake. I waited the allotted time and still no refund. I waited a couple of days, called again and now I was being told 15 business days and they have record of the mistaken item being received at their dock on Dec. 16, 2021. Now I’m getting frustrated. I then called again after the winter break in January 2022 and this time I’m being told 20 business days plus an additional 3-5 business days for my refund to hit my account. Now it’s January 18, 2022 and I still have not received my refund. I have never dealt with this kind of issue with gap. They have outsourced their customer service and it has went down hill tremendously! If you check their reviews and complaints on BBB, you will see so many people having the same issue when it comes to refunds from Gap inc.",GAP
2022-01-14,Janet,5,Shocked by the Negative Reviews!,"Very shocked by all the negative reviews! I've purchased from GAP, Athleta, Banana Republic and Old Navy for years with no problems. Just two months ago, I made a huge order between all 4 brands and returned a lot of stuff to back. All the returns were accepted in a reasonable amount of time and I got refunds for every package.I find the quality of clothes from all the brands to be pretty sufficient for the prices being charged. I mostly love Athleta's style.Lastly, I recommend staying away from buying the YZY collab hoodie. While I've always enjoyed purchasing from GAP and the other brands, fast shipping, fast returns and never had problems, I can't say the same for their YZY merchandise. I ordered the hoodie for someone and it took 2 months to arrive. The quality was like Walmart quality, not very creative, the back of the hoodie was plain, it was $10 shipping, fit way too small, and lastly, if you try to return it to a GAP store, they won't take it. Apparently, it's shipped by a third-party merchant who prints the hoodies, not GAP. That would explain the poor quality and why a $90 hoodie cos $10 to ship when GAP normally gives free shipping after $50. If you try to return it online, you basically go through a headache trying to hound for an answer since the package comes with no invoice or any return labels.Overall, I've had pretty good experiences with GAP (and other brands) so that's why I gave them a 5-star. They could mess up here and there but they never gave me major problems.",GAP

2021-11-24,Upset Customer,1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS! You may not get your order!,"I ordered a few hundred dollars worth of merchandise and Gap/OLDNAVY split the order up: 1 shipment with 14 items, 1 shipment with 1 item (a shirt). LASERSHIP is their preferred free shipping service. Almost immediately it showed shipment 1 as 'DAMAGED and UNDELIVERABLE, contact the shipper'. I contacted LASERSHIP many times with no reply and couldn't speak to a live person. They sent two standard canned responses but never followed up. GAP/OLD NAVY customer service would NOT give me a refund nor make good on the order by sending a replacement order. They said I would have to wait until the listed shipping date passed before they would give a refund. Never mind that not one person could tell me what happened to my package. Most of my experience with normal trusted shippers, not these lowest rated shippers in the USA called LASERSHIP, involved them always delivering a package even with damage. What exactly happened to a box of clothes that made it so damaged it couldn't be delivered? Destroyed in a fire? Water damage? Theft? Who knows?! GAP/OLDNAVY didn't care, only sent an email to LASERSHIP with no followup to me as promised! So me a customer left in the dark, money left on 'hold'. OR did GAP/OLDNAVY damage the package??!! WHO KNOWS??!! LASERSHIP amazingly did get the one shirt delivered on time!! WOW!!!! Imagine them doing their jobs! The bulk of the order, the other package deemed 'DAMAGED & UNDELIVERABLE' was sent back to the GAP by LASERSHIP and never to me. I called and got the refund after the shipping date passed and I didn't receive anything, although it took a few days to process. RUN from the GAP, OLDNAVY, BANANA REPUBLIC!!! If you do order from them, don't use their FREE SHIPPING if it's only with LASERSHIP! Use UPS or FEDEX IF they offer it! I will never shop at these stores again! Thanks for nothing and over 50 years of being a customer!! You are the worst retailers I know of in 2021!",GAP

But this item didn't make it too me ups transferred it to usps and gap had the mailing address wrong from my billing address so it was returned to sender after making it all the way her to my city. I contacted gap them and ask them to resend it back out customer service hung up twice and then third time said they would just refund me my money and when product is available to reorder but the product was a limited edition and sold out. They still ignored me saying that and just issued a refund and gave me a 20 percent discount.

When I received an email from the Gap inviting me to write a review, I clicked on the link, but all it did was prompt me to purchase other items without any guidance whatsoever on how to post a review. It's no wonder. Their average is barely 2 stars! As a single dad with sole financial responsibility for my kiddos, every dollar I earn must be spent wisely. This is a big disappointment. The hard part is my daughter likes the coat, even though I doubt it'll keep her very warm. My suggestion is to bypass the Gap in favor of one of its competitors.",GAP

A lady opened the phone and she was programmed to not to understand what I was saying. I am an international speaker, so I can get that she may not understand at the first time. However, she made me repeated the same thing at least three times and she interrupted me several times while I spoke. So I could not explain my problem. After that I felt that it was very humiliating because I don't think my sentences were hard to understand. I told her I am trying to explain what happened if she lets me. Then, she suddenly complained that I was the one who was not being polite. It was so bad because she made me feel bad about the incidence, she was so reluctant to solve the problem and at the end I said that ok I understand what's going on and she hanged up the phone in a rude way. I haven't seen this type of handling at the other brands' customer services. I hope Gap hires more professional people to their customer service.",GAP

2021-08-18,Mss,1,Totally sketchy delivery,"The Gap is now using the Lasership company for package delivery, I have complained to Gap to no avail but want to let people know how this goes. The Lasership company uses local delivery people who drive their own personal cars with no signage or marking that this is a delivery company, the cars creep around the neighborhood looking for the right house and then a random person gets out with no name tag or credential badge on and tosses the package onto the porch. This has happened multiple times and I have observed this in person. The latest situation happened yesterday and led me to plead with the Gap to re examine who they use as a shipping vendor. A white mini van creeped on my house then parked at the end of my driveway and a little boy approx 9 or 10 years old got out of the van holding a gap package and proceeded to walk up the driveway. I thought perhaps my package had been delivered to the wrong house and he was just bringing it by, when I asked him he said no, my mom drives me around and I run the packages to the house. This is just awful. Hmmmm the Gap prides itself on doing the right thing for women and children and the environment and under developed countries but this is the worst, child labor! I have tried complaining to the Gap and was offered a 10% discount code for my troubles. I refused that because I don't want to be pacified, I want to know they are going to fix this!!!

So, GAP are marking up to make back down, if they remember to reduce it as they say they will. No wonder the stores are in financial trouble.

Their customer service is horrible,they route you to a South American country ( as the rep who answered told me) which would be fine if we could communicate but the only language I speak is English so I am unable to communicate with their customer service reps. The person could not understand anything that I was saying, my order was being shipped to the wrong address and after 10 frustrating minutes that he repeated something that he made up in his head because he couldn’t understand my English, we accomplished nothing. When I kept reading the confirmation number of my order with the letter G for Girl and repeated that many times he kept saying D for dog that was just five minutes of frustration there let alone each and every word that I said he could not understand it and would repeat something completely different . When I told him my order is going to the wrong address and I just placed the order today and I needed it to go to the correct address he repeated so you want to know what date your order is arriving ?He told me that I’m calling a South American country for customer service and then eventually hung up. Although he was polite and with every sentence I said ,he said thank you for that information and repeated thank you for that information many times, with whatever information I gave him he repeated a different sentence .When I placed this order it inadvertently is being sent to me as opposed to the gift recipient and I placed this order today. I repeated numerous times that I placed this order online today as one order he kept repeating I went to a store and I placed one order there and the other order online. I have no idea what he’s even talking about . I could not resolve having this order going to the proper address so now I need to get the order &wrap it and re-ship it to the gift recipient. The whole point of me ordering baby items from baby gap was in order to have it shipped directly to the recipient. Their customer service is horrible and to no fault of the person who does not understand English but unless I spoke another language I definitely could not resolve this problem. Obviously the Gap has their customer service overseas to save money but having properly trained customer service reps who could understand the caller should be of utmost importance.",GAP

That's it! Very simple, easy? NOPE!. I do this all the time with Adidas, Under-Armour, and other stores, and the exchanged items size are often shipped out immediately on confirmation of the returned items with those stores (I returned a top to UA the same day with the GAP/Athleta items, and I am receiving the replaced item in the same week). The 8 items I returned to Athleta were delivered within 3 business days, and I was told that it will take 7-10 business days to process and then the exchanged items will be shipped out, thus, meaning it will take at least 3-4 weeks to receive the corrected/exchanged size unless I paid to place another order for the same items (with corrected size) while the returned items are being processed, thus, tying up $500 of my money. That is insane and very backward. Not only such, but they are also very misleading in their size analysis, my daughter wears a medium from every other brand except this one.

After that GAP didn't bother to send me email that the order was shipped back and even didn't bother to REFUND my money.

Send a return label with the correct item and make it easy on the customer.  The shipping label doesn’t even have the correct item on it.  I’m too exhausted to call your customer service back and explain to them how your trading has failed them that I will simply be disputing the charges.  If people are ordering online it is because they don’t have time to stand in line for you, or shop at the store.  This is not genius but you do need some genius because from reading the other reviews it is obvious that whom ever is in charge of your customer service practices should be fired.

Agent ask the email and give it and she couldn’t find it. I ask her can’t you find under my name or my phone number she said she can’t.till ending up asking my home address( great that’s super weird) ow well end up not resolving the problem( take note! Super awesomely rude( don’t want to deal with it and say bye and hang up. I called the 2nd time (coz I bought gazillion of clothes for my husband) well the gentleman helped me thou and look up my order under the phone number that I am using without even giving my full name, address or some personal details( blows my brain out coz the First Lady can’t find it and boom the gentlemen just saw my order, just like a blink) he said that before cancelling the order they will call me or notify me which they never do at the first place!)( well I’m trying to be cool and don’t want to get mad coz I don’t want to waste my time( patience woooshhhh even my brain cells and my blood is moving to my mouth want to say something but trying to hold it) well he said that they’ll call my bank to verify it which I understand( that’s there SOP) which I do understand. Till he get back to me coz he is trying to call the bank) well he get back saying can’t reach the bank and call me back once they did( which they didn’t until office hours is done done) well, I ask him if I can just change my CC coz I don’t want to deal with it and just to get what I ordered for my husband.( well now my ending is empty handed).I’ll call tomorrow and say the word! No need. Never again! Will never order to them or go to the store!( my patience is gone!!!!)

The least Gap could do is recognize that we are in usual circumstances (and that the post office is in collapse right now), take customers' word about returns, and return our money. It is not acceptable to wait two months for my money back.

I was emailing senseless until Shikyesha today sorted out the mess and gave me the refund I spent weeks requesting. If customer service is failing you right now, I advise giving the chat feature a try. It's much more convenient and saves more time than a phone call and it gets the job done. Thanks again for the quality customer service, Shikyesha!",GAP

First, I ordered $ 300 worth of clothes and 75% of them were canceled due to a backorder which was not showing on their website when I ordered . No one also contacted me to let me know that almost my entire order was canceled. Adding to that the refund was wrong, I had to contact them to get the correct amount for the refund.Also, my order took 2 MONTHS to get here. After 5 emails I sent them asking for a prepaid shipping label because the website wouldn't allow me to print one for some unknown reason, I got an automatic email saying they don't could not help me with my request due to high call volume.So at the end of the day 75% of my order was canceled and what I received that didn't match correctly I'm not getting a refund because they are too busy.This is by far the worst customer service ever.

I've tried calling three separate times and you will just be on hold for the whole time you wait. I've emailed them and they email me back saying they will not be replying due to volume of emails. This is ridiculous. I have never seen a company struggle more than this one. This is so bizarre that I almost feel like I'm dealing with a scam artist. Will I ever receive my order? At this point, I think that won't happen. If someone could get a hold of me I will gladly change my review and mind but for the mean time, do not waste your money on this company. They will gladly take your money, not send you your order, and then won't let you be able to contact them.

I attempted to cancel that item. To date, I have yet to be able to accomplish this.  You cannot do this on line. I’ve spent well over an hour on hold on the phone waiting for a customer service rep.

Later that day, I got an email saying my item has shipped and I don’t want it anymore because Gap has wasted my time. The item will remind me how terrible the customer service is...

They are summer shoes, and by she maybe gets them, it will be fall, and probably too small to wear!  I got a email from Gap today telling me new possible shipping date, and if I want to cancel, call customer service!!  I emailed back, but doubt I will hear back.  I called my bank and tried disputing charges, but have to wait until they ship.  For the rest of you reading this, and waiting for Gap to give you refuns, try calling your credit card number and disputing charges.  I did it recently on another purchase, and it was quick, and company finally reached out to me. Its ridiculous the size of Gap, and all the other stores they own, can't do better even through this covid.  They could be working from home.  The shoes finally arrived this week (july 29).  They were too small!  To be once and for all done with this experience, I took shoes back to Gap store, and got a refund, instead of shipping back.",GAP

Well, not anymore. Not with Gap. Wish there was a minus star option... Suddenly they started cancelling all my orders automatically, each cancellation followed by an obscure email about ""security reasons"" and ""potential fraud"". The first time this happened was during their 50% off sale about 10 days ago,  so I missed out on the item I wanted - my size ran out. Not wanting to waste money on a long international phone call I emailed customer service. But that's useless - you immediately get a reply stating that GAP don't reply to emails. Catch 22, only not funny. Somehow I managed to get them to offer me price adjustment if the item gets back in stock. It did. Now all I had to do was follow instructions - replace the order and reply to the price adjustment email. I did. Another cancellation, and no response to my email because Gap do not respond to emails... Ordered a 3rd time using a different credit card. Order cancelled. Still no response.

The rest of their selection are meh, you can get much better and even cheaper basics on other brands. Personally, I think gap should just focus on making casual workwear inspired clothes. Maybe some 5 pocket/chino style duck canvas pants, field jackets, anything selvedge, there is a gap in that area bec no company as large as GAP (as far as I know) offers those. Actual workwear brands have cuts for actual work and it just looks bad wearing casually so I doubt Gap will compete with them for some time.I would love to have access to 100% cotton heavyweight duck canvas apparel, heavy selvedge denim and everything heavy without having to resort ordering from abroad or online on small stores.",GAP

What's wrong here?You can sit there on your phone waiting for hours, but no human ever responds at the customer service number. Only Tiffany, the irritating Robo girl with the mid-Atlantic accent, is there to reassure the deluded that GAP values you, the customer. GAP, you're moribund retail, and it's a shame that you're bankrupt. But don't you want to leave the retail arena on a positive note, instead of hearing a cacophony of pissed off customers? I've emailed you. I'm waiting...waiting..waiting for a response. I want a refund.",GAP

Next, we tried phoning the Gap customer service line. It rang perhaps 12 times, and then an announcement came on saying that ""no one"" was available to answer our call.

In addition, I am trying to cancel 1 item from a May 15th order because it won't ship until June 11th (supposedly, but who really knows?).  This is by far the absolute worse customer service imaginable.  You cannot reach anyone and there is no one available to help address problems that Gap has itself created.  I understand that there is Covid 19 pandemic but why can't they hire enough customer service phone reps. to answer phones from remote locations, home, etc.?

A mere seconds after I placed the online order, I realized it was shipping to my sister's apt. I called customer service immediately but they told me they could not change the address!! I said are you kidding? this is beyond ridiculous. They said they could only cancel the order and then I would have to reorder everything. I said absolutely not. Then they had the audacity to tell me that one item could not be canceled; remember, this is a mere minute after I clicked place order. So now, one of my christmas gifts is shipping to my sister's apartment. I told them I would never shop with again and that I would cancel my credit card. They thought that sending me a 20% off coupon would mitigate the damages.

This is not surprising as Gap have no respect for there loyal customers either. I have been buying Gap cloths for over 25 years now and recently bought three pairs of Pyjamas worth £44. Unfortunately due to defective materials the garments  have shrunk despite following correct washing instructions. When I wrote an email to there CEO Mr. Peck firstly he does NOT believe in replying to customers directly, as he feels customers are not that important. This is a guy who is paid millions of dollars in salaries and bonus yet takes customers for granted. Eventually I got a reply from a disrespectful member of team who was only blowing Gaps trumpet in how good they are and asked me to take the clothes to a Gap store. Even though I had bought the garments online and supplied pictures which don’t lie I was basically told to get lost in the usual Gap language. I use to spend over £1000 per annum but for sake of £44 these amateurish organisations behaved in an abhorrent way despite supplying proof with pictures. I would never buy from these cowboys again. Beware as they DO NOT appreciate loyalty and should you experience any faults with your garments they will tell you to go for a ride. Avoid buying from them is the only way to hurt these cowboys in taking customers for a ride in this abhorrent way.",GAP

However the customer service is on point and all the workers are very helpful and nice.

I must have rung gap up to 8 tones over the period of a month to get this sorted. In the meantime I was given a discount an had to reorder again even though I’d had no refund for the first order. I thought it was a joke when my second order arrived again in the wrong size. So I sent it back and for some reason it was refunded in a week. I had to then reorder another colour just to get a hoody in the right size but eventually after much messing around fone calls to customer services an trips to the post office to return I was happy I’d finally got the hoody in the right size. I spent the next two weeks chasing the refund for my first order I told customer services I was not happy with all the messing about and I think they should compensate me, she said she would email me some vouchers but she never did. She said she was launching an inquiry in to the warehouse to locate my return an this may take a few days. After 2 days they email me saying they are refunding me but not at the price I paid but the discount price is been given on my second order!! For gods sake I’ve never know such incompetence ever, first time I’ve ordered on line an never again in fact never shopping at gap again. I call customers services to sort it all out again and went though having to explain the whole issue I’d been going through the advisor was rude and hung up on me so I had to call back again and again explain to another advisor called Debbie who within seconds clearly didn’t want to hear me moving about my longwinded story and refunded me for the first order at the price I paid. She couldn’t get me off the phone quick enough! Always speak to an American call centre and out of the 8 times I had to call all the advisors were trying to help me but two were rude patronising and the tone on their voice smarmy and sarcastic made me really annoyed. At last all of this hassle and I’ve been told I will get my refund but how long that will take I don’t know. I wish I’d have seen all these reviews before attempting to buy a jumper on line.

2019-01-05,JG,1,Very slow refund policy,Sadly I agree with lots of the reviews already posted here.  The refund process takes far too long. Itrms returned 3 weeks ago have yet to be refunded and a Gap email notifies me that it could take a further 1-2 months? Why? Other stores process refunds within days. Unacceptable and won't order online from Gap again.,GAP
2018-12-31,TimD,1,Widespread quality control issue.,"Ive been a GAP customer for over 20 years. Quality was okay before but now you cant even breath on thier garments and they fall apart. In the last few years I have purchased sweatshirt hoodies, jeans, socks and t shirts, and i can safely say that all of these are now in a bin liner and being used as shop rags for when i do services on my cars. The socks all had holes in after one wear. The waistbands on all the hoodies have loosened after one wear and turned into baggy dresses. The jeans have all worn out and split at the crotch after only 2 washes. GAP if you are reading this I am more than happy to show you your rubbish clothing, but you probably dont need to do that as your buying and QC teams are well aware of how shoddy your clothing has become. Disgraceful.",GAP

Ordered total 18 items and checked with GAP customer care on Dec 5th, 2018 for confirmation of delivery by Dec 11,2018. After waiting for delivery until Dec 13th, 2018, I called GAP customer care and came to know that UPS is returning the package to GAP and UPS tracking number is not provided to me.  When I connected with UPS for package, they were looking for UPS tracking number which is not provided to me by GAP. Its really frustrating to coordinate with GAP and UPS for delivery of shipment. I have been forced to cancel the order. Never recommend anyone to use GAP products because of worst service experience!",GAP

You can see they have great team spirit, i had a lady and a man helping me and another lady also offered to help her colleagues. Wish I had got their names. They are an asset to the company.

I wasted 40 minutes in their store today while they tried to look up my card, only to be told I’ll have to call customer service on my own time to - probably never - resolve my issue. My advice is DO NOT get a GAP credit card, unless you’re a fan of headaches. I completely regret getting the credit card, and I’m not going to even bother shopping there again to redeem my rewards after my waste of time today. University Village Gap store in Seattle had awful customer service. The manager was barely willing to lift a finger to help. And was annoyed that she had to reexplain their ridiculous policy. No apologizes, no real sympathy, no offering how to make it easier in any way. Repeat: DO NOT GET A CREDIT CARD. And save yourself from the staff at U village GAP, and shop... anywhere else.",GAP

Gap doesn't tell you an expected ship date until a couple days later and now I find out that the order won't make it in time for Father's Day.  I called them and told them it never said the delivery date would be so much later than 1 day, they said I should have found their delivery policy online.  I asked them to refund the expedited delivery and they said they would not do that.  So you are going to hide the expected delivery date from your customer, and then won't refund the cost of the expedited shipping once it was clear that there wasn't any notification during ordering.  This is bs.  Gap also didn't inform me that this purchase would be a Mail Only return until after I was sent the confirmation email for the order.  If I had known that you can't return the item in the store, I would have shopped somewhere else.  I am NEVER using gap online ever again.  Borderline criminal.",GAP

That is it. No, they cannot help me with that.2. Having lost the receipt, my return was not accepted. Although, online info says """"Without proof of purchase and order date, you can return items for a merchandise exchange or a merchandise certificate only based on the selling price on the date of return.” No. That is not possible. Just not possible. They don't do that sort of thing. That online information probably means something else.Emailing does not get you anywhere. They do not respond.

Noticed they are phasing out popular jeans and bringing out more expensive ones that don’t differ much compared to the cheaper ones. Customer service recently couldn’t give me an answer as to why Hermes said a package of mine was delivered and signed for by me. I was at home all day and a delivery attempt was not made. Instead of looking into this with Hermes I was told by Gap to wait to align with their internal timings for raising delivery disputes. While they have my money for a package that is either lost or stolen. Similar has happened to my parents with a Gap packaged delivered by Hermes - left in a safe space a week ago but no package in sight. Gap have not done anything. Hermes can apparently do no wrong.,GAP

The woman on the phone explained to me that the jacket was never shipped from them it was supposed to be shipped from a store and the store must not have had the jacket in stock so they were unable to fulfill the order. So the store who had no jacket to ship left it at that our card was charged we did not receive product left it at that if I would not have called I wonder what would have happened. No emails no apologies and now almost 3 weeks later my son has no winter jacket mind you we live in Minnesota mind you that not a Gap store around us even sells winter jackets in the store there's a problem right there hello it is Minnesota why can we not carry jackets in the store why do I need to order them online. Anyways after I cancelled the order this morning to get my refund because apparently there was no jacket ever but nobody was ever going to tell me that. I was sent an email telling me that my item has been returned we returned our item and we will be refunded no we did not return anything we never received it and we were charged for it a lot of other places don't charge you until the item is shipped like there's a huge problem here that needs to be resolved and the only thing that was done about it it was covered up and hidden from maybe somebody who could fix the. By saying that we return the item looks like we didn't like it that never happened we never received an item. And now it's going to take up to 10 days for us to get our money back for something we never even had in my book that's stealing they stole our money if we did that to them they would have put us in jail thank you gap for all your wonderful years of wonderful beautiful comfortable clothing but my relationship with you has came to an end.,GAP
2017-12-13,Garret ,1,North Korea probably has faster shipping and better service,"Awful. Ordered 27th of November and my order was only shipped on the 10th of December, after numerous times chatting their customer service. They were never helpful and kept just sending macros and pre-written 'apologies' about the delay. They promised me overnight shipping and even swore that it would be shipped from the UK to Ireland at 10pm on the 7th of December for arrival on the next morning. Obviously it didn't turn up. Following that I got an email saying they're backlogged and it could take 30 days (!?) to ship, maximum. I ordered two things. I've bought cheap tat from China without tracking that's arrived faster.So on the 10th, I get an email saying it's shipped. Phew. That's a relief. But no, no it isn't. The tracking still hasn't updated as of the 12th - so I chat them again. The girl straight up offers me a refund. I didn't even ask - which makes me think something was up. I did ask, 'So I'm not getting my order - given it was mean to be overnighted?' and she said it looks unlikely. So now I have a charge on my account waiting to be reversed for an order I placed 3 weeks ago - that was never sent. Just awful all around.

Here is where things become ugly ,when I did not receive the items on that dateI checked in to see the order status and was changed to be delivered on December 05 ,2017(Still okay with this:)). I started following on the status knowing that they might change it again and when I checked again on the  4th of December 2017,they again updated the delivery date to the 09th of December and now I called to customer service knowing that they might do something about it.The person(male forgot his name?) I talked to was nice and willing to help me with that. First he said sorry for that and took off the shipping and handling fee and guaranteed it will be delivered on the 06th of December. I followed up and saw the status is still on the 09th of December and I thought he might forgot to update me. I called again on the 05th of December to talk to another agent (her name may be Amanda? sorry for that)She said that I need to call to the carrier(Which I thought is none of my business) to hold the item in their facility until I return back( what?)I told her I need the item as a gift to the persons I'm traveling to. She keep on holding me a lot of times as if she's figuring out something(Which I don’t think much is going on while I was in hold...probably I was in hold for 20minutes) anyways, She comes backand told me she is taking off 30% of the price I was charged, Still told her I don’t need the price adjustments and needed to talk to the supervisor. She told me thatthe supervisor will do nothing at all and I told her I will at least try my chances to pass my concerns. After the usual long hold, I 'm able totalk to the supervisor(which do nothing as the agent suggested, at least the agent got this right:)) to my surprise to inform me that the order is cancelled and the amount will be credited(What?) Did I tell you  to cancel my order? the Supervisor is horrible and I don’t think she should be there. I told her why they are losing customers toAmazon and other big players and told her I will never be GAP's /Banana Republic's customer anymore(thank you for taking my money for more than a decade) and will write my experience onthe review to their site and any social networking sites I use.

There were 4 working days and even despatch notification was only sent after I complained twice. Customer service didn't have any knowledge what was happening with my order and just said ""it SHOULD arrive this week"" - but I'm guessing they did find something and did something as I received despatch notification on that day later on.

Customer support wont reply to my emails, facebook messages or answer the phone. Ive never ordered from gap before, ive always thought of them as a good, reliable company.

I was out of town for wedding and unfortunately there was no service at all, so I missed few of my usual payments and as I came back I paid some of them right the way but as I had some extra expenses on my brothers wedding I left the Gap bill to be paid on the next due date as I was already late and late payment fee was already applied so it makes more sense for me to just make my next payment on the next due date. But wait! they are calling me from 15 to 27 times a day literally starting at 7am and up until 11pm constant calling Even though I had spoken to a costumer service right after I came back and explained what happend and what is my plan they said It is absolutely understandable and that they will be expecting next payment when it is due. But the calling never stopped I had to block one of their numbers because it feels absolutely wrong to receive this many calls after you spoke to someone about it but now they call from Russia . This is just absurd I only missed one payment First time since I had this card. I am going to close this account when I pay it off and will never have another card with them again . What they do called Stalking and it makes people very uncomfortable . Shame on you guys you should know better",GAP

I checked the tracker on Collect+ and was told the package had been returned to GAP more than 10 days earlier. Contacted GAP again - was told there was a delay of up to TWO WEEKS in processing returns once they arrived at the warehouse 'because of the holidays'. I ordered my package on 15/1 and returned on 24/1, go figure. Told them I was unhappy about the service and would not be buying from GAP again.

Finally after three weeks and many hours wasted on hold the agent suggested cancelling the order and buying them in the store which I did.  However, the now unwanted supposedly cancelled jeans showed up the next day!  Another call to online customer service and more time on hold, and as a courtesy I was told I could keep the jeans and they would credit me back the price.  Unfortunately we no longer needed the jeans because I had bought another set and they were the wrong size anyway. The agent on the phone at the time said just take them back to the store and exchange them for something else. But the store won't honor the exchange because it was a dispute with gap.com, and gap.com won't honor the exchange because they have terrible customer service.  It doesn't help me to have free jeans that don't fit, so the courtesy they extended to acknowledge the hassle they put me through is meaningless.

I would not recommend gap for any holiday shopping as they seem to have no interest in backing up their promised delivery date ranges, unless you are Jewish.

When I received the first letter they sent me about it, I called their customer service and they said that my application would be deleted and everything was taken care of. I then received another letter today. THREE WEEKS AFTER they said it was taken care of saying that my credit card was approved. I then had to call @gap again where I was hung up on and transferred SEVERAL times to finally speak to someone that could help me. She was unbelievably rude and unhelpful. She said that my application was redacted and when I asked for my name and details to be removed from the system she proceeded to create an inquiry into this, and said I would receive a letter in twenty days. When I asked why it would take twenty days to just delete my basic information from the system and what the letter would say she was unable to give me any further information. And then threatened me that she would not send my inquiry in. Needless to say I am extremely annoyed, aggravated, and among other things will not be supporting @gap at any of their stores or sister stores. It is a complete outrage to be treated like this when this is @gap mistake. I posted this on Gap's Facebook page and they responded almost a day later that they do not deal with the card accounts and I need to speak to Synergy Bank that is in charge of this.

2016-04-23,Hayley,1,Appalling Customer Service,"If you can, avoid shopping with Gap online from Austalia. Western Australia doesn't have a Gap store so my only option was ordering goods from the US (even after phoning the Melbourne store but they wouldn't post). The shipping of two pairs of girls shorts cost $42, almost as much as the shorts alone were worth. After a week, I inquired about the shipping advice (given I hadn't received a dispatch confirmation) only to be told that the goods had already been delivered. The problem was that I was in Australia and the goods had been delivered to somewhere in Illinois, US. After corresponding with Gap and asking them to resend the goods but expedite the shipping, given I had lost a week from the original timeline, I was advised post-shipment that the original timeline of the order had been extended and that they may take between 2.5 to 5 weeks to arrive, not counting the week lost from the incorrect delivery. The original advice communicated from Gap in the sales transaction was 2-4 weeks. Gap customer service was at best ambivalent, seemingly wanting to shift responsibility to Borderfree. When paying A$42 for shipping for a package of probably less than 1kg, I expect better service, as I can imagine, would others. Additionally, after further correspondence with Gap's customer service, they stated that if I was unhappy with their online ordering that I could set up a US address and ship there. It's quite stunning really that a company like Gap would offer this as an alternative rather than improving global business and addressing deficiencies in their point to point shipping. Put simply, avoid shopping online at Gap from Australia until they actually start to listen to customers. Until then, they are only paying lip service about customer service and overcharging overseas customers with exorbitant shipping rates.",GAP

My unpleasant experience began on Jan 30, 2016 at gap store in Wolfchase mall in memphis TN. I meant with Manager David and Customer Rep Darren, who after a completed transaction so they called it could not give me a confirmed receipt they placed online stating the email would come, even until today Feb 9, 2016 I have not received the so called transaction. They were giving flimsy excuses about wifi this or that... Later come to find out my order was messed up as of today and the prices as they showed me in the store was not the prices the online associates put. As an evidence, My credit card when I called them had a recorded voice of myself and the rep telling the amount of price to approve for the transaction.  My point here is please BEWARE of gap store both online and in store, they are not what they say they are... They perform fraudulent activities on your account if you do not monitor your account on a regular basis and their customer Service is very very very poor. They lack transparency and Intergrity.Customers PLEASE BEWARE!!!! Will NEVER BUY from GAP AGAIN. What a horrible experience.

2015-10-04,Julie ,1,"Poor customer service, your online delivery people made a mistake and I have to pay for it?","My mom had 100 dollars Gap Cash from when she shopped in NY with my sister. In Colorado, we decided to each spend 100 in Gap, she paid for everything and I paid her back. Before going in, I looked at some Gap ""featured"" outfits and really liked the plaid Henley shirt paired with the flair out pants. We got to the store, but only one plaid Henley shirt was there in XL, not my size. However, I did find the flair out pants. My mom had liked a silk shirt I showed her online, but it also wasn't in store because it was a new style. My mistake, to look online and expect to find it in store. So, we bought the things we could in store, and the cashier ordered the silk shirt and plaid henley, both in medium, through Gap.com. Three weeks later, the package arrives (it took a while), inside was the silk shirt, but instead of the Henley shirt, there is a pair of leggings with a label on it saying it is the plaid Henley. I research online to see which store in Colorado might have the plaid Henley in the right color and size medium. Unfortunately, shirt is sold out online in s, m, and l. The only store that has the right shirt style is in Aurora, 45 minutes away from my house. I put on hold the Medium and Large, the medium was in the wrong color but i was trying it for size, my last resort if the large didn't work being to have my sister in NY get it, which would be complicated because it's an exchange and not just a purchase. Finally, i get to Gap in Aurora and decide the Large is ok. But, because the plastic was labeled as plaid henley and had leggings in it, they said I could not just give them the leggings in exchange for the shirt. The whole process took at least 30 minutes, mostly the employee was getting instructions from a lady on the phone. My review is not against the Gap employees at this store, but rather the lady who was on the phone and Gap.com. Anyways, I didn't just walk out with the plaid Henley (already paid for mind you), I had to pay for the shirt and then now have to ship the leggings to Gap and wait 7 days to be refunded for the shirt. It was so complicated and I have to to all this extra work now. Hopefully I will even be refunded correctly because the receipt from paying today said the tax was 8%, whereas the invoice from online (what was paid before) says 4.25%. What I paid for the plaid Henley was also 50 cents more than the original purchase. So basically, I may be out just a couple dollars, which is ok, but annoying, gas, and time spent. Not much, but it's a lot when it wasn't my mistake and they still make me pay for THEIR mistake. I don't even want this shirt that bad anymore, it didn't fit that nicely because my boobs are too big for it and so the large fit better for that reason, but is wider than would be most flattering. Whatever, I'm ok with that though. Nevertheless, I'm never shopping at Gap or any affiliate stores again because this experience was so annoying and I think their clothes are boring (At Gap).I honestly don't want anything from Gap, like restitution, but they just better refund me correctly. Originally I paid 35.80 for the shirt (cheaper since we used gap cash) but today I paid 37.75 because the shirt cost more and the tax was double. So which will they refund me? The ladies at the store said they'll refund the invoice which is less than what I paid today. Why am I paying for your mistake??",GAP
2015-08-19,Joseph Anderson,1,Appalling customer service and bad quality control of clothing items,"I received a pair of jeans through the post which had been obviously poorly manufactured due to the fact that the fit in each leg was completely different: tight in one leg and loose in the other. As a result I called Gap Customer Service and they told me they couldn't exchange items but could refund them and get me the same pair of jeans at the same discounted price that I got them in before, which seemed like a rather arduous and unnecessary process. However, the assistant out in a new order to the same delivery location that I previously had them delivered to, without heeding me or asking any questions. I wanted to get the jeans sent to a work address because unfortunately I do not always have the luxury of being at home. Even after explaining this I was simply told that the order couldn't be cancelled definitively and the assistant would have to put in a cancellation request that doesn't always go through, which would have ended up in me getting 2 pairs of the same jeans.

I purchased Gap apparel because we had a large family and the clothing wore so very well. I shop at both the Keystone Mall Store and at the Edinburg outlet store.     My daughter who also has a Gap account had been in the outlet store and spent over 200.00$.  She had purchased mostly for her children but also bought herself a pair of very soft sweat pants the middle of May. After 4 washing th e fabric had broken down so much you could SEE through it. She purchased then May11 but by July they were literally threadbare. She returned them(10.99) on sake because the fabric was defective!  She had her receipt but was advised they don't accept returns that have been ""washed or worn"" or past 90 days. So.... Buy wet beware if you receive anything defective and you have washed it or worn it you CANT return it.     The asst. manager was not pleasant or helpful and ""we were informed it was corporate policy"". I have a feeling that ""corporate isn't doing too well"". You used to be able to depend on quality clothing- now it pills and in the case if the pants see through after a few washing.      I can only compare them to J.Crew located in both locations that Gap is.

(3 groups of grandkids in US/Abroad) As of today (12-9) 2 of the 3 orders is sitting in ""pending"" I called CS with Gap and was treated rudely, I actually had to ask her to ""stop talking so I could ask a question""  This Grandma will NEVER shop at Gap again!",GAP

2014-11-21,Treasure,1,Almost 2month wait for a winter coat!!,"I shopped at Gap online Nov 7th,2014 for a winter coat for my son. At time of purchase est delivery was Nov 23,2014. At the time I figured that was not that bad, however I live in Cleveland, Ohio so snow came early this year so even Nov 23rd was to late. Now I check my order status and it says my son coat is estimated to come Dec 23,2014. That is ridiculous!!! I am so upset. So now I will have to go purchase another coat because we can not wait that long. Very unhappy : (. I did notify Gap but I doubt if there is anything they can do about it.",GAP
2014-11-09,Biagio,5,Bond Street GAP Store - Outstanding,"I stocked up on my winter wear on Friday this week.  Initially started at the GAP store on Regent Street. I was in the Regent Street Store for all of 15 minutes, I had to escape due to the broken speakers blaring out music at the top volume and also staff that were unsure of promotions as well as being unaware of their customers in store. After being let down in Regent Street I decided to go to the bond Street Store and was there for an hour.  Took my time choosing and trying what I needed and the staff were super friendly and efficient from fitting room, shop floor to the till point.  The floor manager (I assume) even stopped a briefing with some of the staff on the floor to ask me what size I could like in a jumper she saw i was looking at and contemplating. Thats service. The service in this store was amazing, not too much, but enough for you to feel valued and looked after if you needed it.  It also has better stock options.   Regent Street: Looks like you need to tips from Bond Street.",GAP
2014-10-03,Chicken Huy,3,Clothes Are Reliable but Design Needs Revamp,"I've grown up wearing gap clothes. Their clothes have been reliable through the years, but their design is a little bit...dare I say it...antiquated. It needs a refresh. Brands like Uniqglo, American Apparel, and Zara have the edge and I'm leaning towards making a purchase from them.",GAP
2014-09-23,shannon,1,"Customer service doesn't even try to help, even when it's their fault","I'm so frustrated right now.  I made 3 purchases that qualified for ""GapCash"".  Their system didn't send me the email with the offer code.  I reached out to customer service to find out that the offer expired last week.  The rep didn't offer to help at all.  How is this my error?  I've been a loyal Gap customer for 25+ years.  This is awful!",GAP
2014-05-20,Wurls,1,Terrible customer service,I ordered 4 items. 2 items were sent in the wrong size. I returned them and was told I could only get a refund and they would not send the correct items. Terrible service ... I will vote with my money and never buy from the Gap again.,GAP
2014-04-23,Gretchen Brown,4,"Reliable clothing, good customer service",I have been shopping on gap.com for my family for years.  Most of our clothing basics come from Gap.  I especially love their waist cinchers for kids clothing.  But the best thing about them is their sales.  Can even get up to 40% off.,GAP
2014-04-12,Vince,1,terrible,"I ordered online a pair of. Jeans, size 33 inch waist. I received a pair labelled as 33, but sized a huge 42 inch waist. I returned and received another pair, again labelled 33 but sized 42.I have returned and re ordered five times, all faulty.All my attempts at customer service contact , eight and counting, have resulted in an apology, and a promise of both an investigation and a correct replacement. Gap have repeatedly failed on both counts. Gap are unable to either identify the problem, nor correct it. I suspect gap are too embroiled in beurocracy, poor communication, ineptitude and mis management to be able to provide an acceptable product or service.",GAP
2014-03-14,Alexa Dunnigan,5,Always classic.,I remember first going into a Gap Kids store as a child. The brand still serves a fundamental purpose in my shopping and waredrobe as an adult. They remain a go to for basics and those pieces that you just need as the foundation to your closet. Always seem to have great sales that make for great stocking up trips too!,GAP

2013-12-11,Steph W.,4,Classic styles and easy ordering,"I like ordering from Gap because their clothes never really goes out of style, and is safe to use for multiple seasons. As a college student, saving money is really important, so I like Gap a lot. They also have great sales a few times during the year so I stock up then. I happily recommend them!",GAP
2013-11-15,Hary ,4,Great store,"Quality is reliable, clear labelling in terms of clothing materials. Exchange or refund is painless and yet, salesperson can sense whether or not they can trust the customer before taking goods back or exchange. Great skills for that. Hope it keeps up.",GAP
2013-11-13,Ranti Elude,2,Used to be good,"Used to be my go to store for causals. But now, quality is going down the slope and the styles are quite boring In addition the sizing is not consistent I have to try out every pant and goes up a size with each washing",GAP
,Hanna Burnett,2,Over the years GAP increases prices and decreases quality. How disappointing.,"I have never in my life had a problem with jeans wearing out. That's why I bought from GAP. Yes, their product was moderately expensive, but they fit me fantastically and moreover they LASTED. I would get new jeans more because of growing out of them or significant style changes, but usually I'd wear them for two or three years with no problem whatsoever. In recent years though prices have climbed. What's more, to add insult to injury the quality has plummeted. The company where I used to get jeans for $45 and keep them for three years now charges me $70 for jeans that rip or wear through in a little more than a year. (I am no more active while wearing my jeans than I used to be, if anything I am less so!) Stubbornly I use iron-on patches and rotate the poorer quality pairs into less public/frequent use. Today though is perhaps the final straw. A pair roughly one year old suddenly has a sizable hole on the inner thigh. I feel so betrayed. For over 10 years I give brand loyalty to GAP and this is how I am repaid? By considerably more expensive but far poorer quality products than when I first began shopping with them? If only because I have an unused gift card I will give them one final chance. But after that I plan to find a new brand.",GAP

2009-11-30,karen kroll,1,"They say they ""can't"" and they mean ""won't""","I tried to return a birthday present I'd bought online about an hour after I bought it, as I realized I'd failed to take advantage of an offer.  They refused to cancel it, said they could not do it, they could only put in a ""request"" to cancel.  Not only that, but they HAVE NO IDEA when they can tell if if it's canceled or not.   Bull.  They can process an order within minutes, but they can't cancel it within minutes, and in fact ""have no idea"" if it will be DAYS before they can tell you it's canceled?  And get this:  I wanted to cancel so I could go online and make a LARGER purchase!  Now I can't buy a LARGER birthday present for this person because I don't know if the first one was canceled or not!!!  When they say they ""can't,"" they mean ""won't.""  They need some serious customer-friendly competition to make them realize what they can or can't do.  I would NEVER use them again.",GAP
2009-10-24,Nell Nestor,1,don't go there,"I purchased some jeans for my daughters for Christmas. AFTER the purchase was completed, there was a note about their ""new"" return policy.  Seems that returns/exchanges can only be done for 45 days.  Christmas is 60 days away.  Multilple emails to customer ""service"" were fruitless--as another reviewer said, ""arrogant and smarmy"" would about cover it.  So I returned the merchandise forthwith. Gap must be doing very well if they're  OK with losing a sale and alienating not one but potentially 3 customers.",GAP
